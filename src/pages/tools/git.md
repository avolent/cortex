## Setting Up Github SSH Keys

### Linux / WSL / MacOS

**Generate a SSH Key[^2] or use a pre-existing one [^3]**  
In the terminal use the following command to generate a key.

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**Start the ssh-agent in the background.**

```shell
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566
```

**Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.**

```shell
ssh-add ~/.ssh/key_name
```

**Now add the key to your github account**
Copy the contents of your key and add to your github account under - [New SSH Key](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)

```shell
cat ~/.ssh/key_name.pub
```

**You can test your connection with the following:**
```shell
$ ssh -T git@github.com
> Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.
```
