## Initial Setup

Useful video for setup of pfsense and basic settings. [^3]

### 4. [/System/General Setup](https://192.168.1.1/system.php)

**Theme** = pfsense Dark.  
**Top Navigation** = Fixed.  
**Dashboard Columns** = 3.  

### 5. [/System/Package Manager/Available Packages](https://192.168.1.1/pkg_mgr.php)

```
darkstat (Optional)
iperf (Optional)
nmap (Optional)
pfblockerng-devel (Important)
```

### 6. [/System/User Manager/Users](https://192.168.1.1/system_usermanager.php)

Add a new local user and attach them to the administrator group.  
Log out and log into the new user.  

### 8. [/Interfaces/WAN](https://192.168.1.1/interfaces.php?if=wan)

Changing port assignments can be done in [/Interfaces/Assignments](https://192.168.1.1/interfaces_assign.php).  
Most things are fine as default in here.
If you need/want IPV6 change **DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation size** to the size your internet provider has given you.  

### 7. [/Services/DHCP Server/LAN](https://192.168.1.1/services_dhcp.php)

Enable **Change DHCP display lease time from UTC to local time** (Do the same for IPv6).  
Assign your **Static IP** addresses.  

### 8. [/Services/DNS Resolver/General Settings](https://192.168.1.1/services_unbound.php)

Enable **DNSSEC** Support.  
Enable **Python Module** (Leave the settings default) *If you want regex blocking*.  

### 9. [/Services/Dynamic DNS/Dynamic DNS Clients](https://192.168.1.1/services_dyndns.php)

Create a Cloudflare ddns client.  

### 10. [/Firewall/pfBlockerNG](https://192.168.1.1/pfblockerng/pfblockerng_general.php) [^4]

**CRON Settings** = Once a day.  

### 11. [/Firewall/pfBlockerNG/IP](https://192.168.1.1/pfblockerng/pfblockerng_ip.php) - Make sure you force reload at the end to save changes.

Enable **Floating Rules**.  
Enable **Kill States**.  
Add **MaxMind License Key**.  

### 12. [/Firewall/pfBlockerNG/DNSBL](https://192.168.1.1/pfblockerng/pfblockerng_dnsbl.php) 

**DNSBL Mode** = Unbound Python Mode *If you want regex blocking*.  
**Regex Blocking** = Enable.  
**DNSBL IPs - List Action** = Deny Both.  
Add all your feeds and enable them.  

MAKE SURE YOU **UPDATE/RELOAD ALL** TO MAKE SURE CHANGES ARE ACTIVE!!

If you get an error about running out of memory, this could be related to your firewall maximum table entry size. Since pfblockerNG is using a lot of rules you may need to increase even more as seen in a previous step. [^6]  

### PFBlockerNG Feeds

The following feeds are what I currently use!

```bash
PRI1
PRI2
PRI1_6
Easylist
ADs
AD_Basic
Cryptojackers
Firebog_Advertising
```

## UPNP

Configuring the following is great for devices which have strict NAT type when playing games.  
Device used in this example is a **Nintendo Switch** [^1].  

### 1. [/Services/DHCP Server/LAN](https://192.168.1.1/services_dhcp.php)

Assign device a static IP.  

### 2. [/Services/UPnP & NAT-PMP](https://192.168.1.1/pkg_edit.php?xml=miniupnpd.xml&id=0)

Enable the following:  
**UPnP & NAT-PMP**  
**Allow UPnP Port Mapping**  
**Allow NAT-PMP Port Mapping**  
**Log packets handled by UPnP & NAT-PMP rules.**  
**Deny access to UPnP & NAT-PMP by default.**  

Within **ACL Entries** add the device configured with the static IP like so.  
`allow 53-65535 192.168.1.246/32 53-65535`

### 3. [/Firewall/NAT/Outbound](https://192.168.1.1/firewall_nat_out.php)

Configure your Outbound NAT mode to **Hybrid**  
Add the following rule.  
**Interface:** WAN  
**Address Family:** IPv4 + IPv6 (IPv4 only if IPv6 not enabled)  
**Protocol:** Any  
**Source:** Network | deviceip/32 | no port range  
**Destination:** Any  
**Translation Address:** Interface Address  
**Translation Port or Range:** Empty | Check the static box  

Then add a **description** to this rule.  

Your device should now have a better NAT Type when playing games.  

## Port Forwarding

Port forward so that you can host games on your internal network and share with your friends externally.  

### 1. [/Firewall/NAT/Port Forward](https://192.168.1.1/firewall_nat.php)

Add a rule for a port you would like to forward.  
**Interface:** WAN  
**Address Family:** IPv4 (Unless you need IPv6)  
**Protocol:** TCP / UDP or Both  
**Destination:** WAN  
**Destination Port Range:** Either a single port or a range. (This is the external port that will be connected too.)  
**Redirect IP:** The device IP hosting the server.  
**Redirect Target Port:** This is the port in which your server is using. (Multiple rules required for multiple ports.  
**Description:** Description for the rule.  
**Filter rule association:** Add associated filter rule.  

Save the rule.  

> These ports should now be open to internet. BE CAREFUL and open only what is needed. Block unecessary global subnets etc via PFBlockerNG.
