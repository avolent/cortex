## Goal

The goal of this wiki is to be an accumulation and amalgamation of information from various different topics. Hoping that the act of building in the wiki format improves the ability to retain and explain whatever I have learnt. Something a long the lines of the Feynman Technique - a mental model (a breakdown of his personal thought process) to convey information using concise thoughts and simple language.  
Brain dumps and a collection notes/resources from my personal projects.  
Notes may include information and tips from other peoples guides. This will be referenced when required.
